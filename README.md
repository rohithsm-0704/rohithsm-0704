## Hi there 👋
Hi 👋, I’m Rohith  

I work with data to understand problems, find patterns, and support better business decisions.  
My focus is on turning raw, messy data into insights that are easy to explain and actually useful.

I regularly use **SQL** to explore and transform data (joins, CTEs, window functions, aggregations),  
**Python** for data cleaning and analysis, and **Excel / BI tools** to communicate insights through clear dashboards and reports.

I care more about asking the right questions and delivering clarity than building overly complex solutions.  
If an insight can’t be explained simply, it’s not finished yet.
